      <h3> My Learning Plan </h3>
    <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> My long term goal is to hopefully be in a stable career field/job as a software developer that I would genuinely enjoy and would also have flexiblity to 
      make time for my family in the future. My fiance and I are going to be a young married couple both 25 and 24 years of age and have the goal to be somewhat
      stable in our carrer fields in the up coming years to take care of our family and travel as well. </p>
      <br> 
      <br> 
        <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </strong>
        </p>My biggest limitations would making time for my studies/learning period and then more so stick to the time or plan 
      I had created and then striving to be consistent with it. My strengths would be my willingness to learn once I've
    actually started and then because my curiosity stars to set in I then start to focus more and get the task at hand finished</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong> What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
      <p> I do have a goal do that I'd hope to achieve at the end of the year in personal development. One being a better 
       consistent studier and a strong discilpine to get thins started and completed. As well as becoming a better communicator both to the 
       facilitators and fellow students. Another big one for me is being able to be the end of the year openly express ideas or opinions 
       on a matter or project without hesitation even if it might seem "contradictory" or "indifferent" or even if the idea doesnt get used. That would be huge confident booster
       to me and create a habbit of contributing to group dicussions. 
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>
       <p> This year, I personally decided to manage my studies in a way that keeps me organized, productice and mindful of how my actions 
        can impact others. To do this I created three strageties to focus on. Setting goals, creating a strucured plan and satying accountable 
        especially in group projects, and if issues arise unexpectedly communicating to the facilitators and fellow class members on ways to solve those issues. By 
      following this approach hopefully I will stay organized, less stress and be effective in my workload throughout the year.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
      <p> I usally try and find answers to questions or concerns I have ether from google, youtube or even chatgpt. And if I still cant 
        find a solution to the problem I would then reach out to the facilitator. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
      <p>To be honest the expectations I had from the facilitators they are already meeting them. I had expecations of 
        answering/helping any concerns or questions us fellow students might have, really attentive/supportive towards our wellbeing and 
        reaching out via discord or email if we need help on any part of the assignment and I would just say feedback really. I am 
        all ears for feedback so do not hestiate to give feedback or me wether it might seem harsh or not I am totally fine wth 
        it to improve and get better. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong>
       <p> For my scheduling I'm quite flexible the only days I cant do are Sundays every weekend and wedesday evenings, and Monday to Friday from 5am to 2pm. After 
        2pm I am free. I also cant do june 14-18th for a family reunion later this year and september 10th-17th thats the week of my wedding and I think late october or november I will by in sydney for in laws reunion. I'm 
      real easy going and am willing to make time if necessary for group studies or group projects.</p>
