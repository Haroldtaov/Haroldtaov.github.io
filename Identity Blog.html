          <h3> IDENTITY & VALUES </h3>
        <strong>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Recently making the decision to move back to New Zealand was one of the biggest choices I've ever had to make, but ultimately, it was an ethical one 
          rooted in love, commitment and family values. I chose to return not out of obligation but because I genuinely wanted to for my fiance and for the future of our 
        relationship. This decision wasnt just about logistics but it was about prioritizing the poeple who matter most in my life. Ethically, I felt it was the right thing to do, I personally believe 
      relationships thrive when both partners are willing to make sacrifices and invest in their futures. Additionally, family plays a huge role in my values, and knowing that my grandparents are here, I wanted
      to be closer to them while I still have the opportunity. Life is short, and being present for them and as well as for my fiance felt like the right decision both morally and emotionally. While it was a huge step, I have no regrets because I made this choice from a place of integruity and love. 
      </p>

          <br> 
            <strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </strong>
            </p> I was born and raised in avondale here in auckland. I was raised by both my Samoan granparents and then right next door I had my cousins and their parents. Being raised by my grandparents I was raised in a old school samon environment and was taught at a young age values of faith, my hertitage, valuing our elders, being made to play piano(I had no choice in that it was a must) and the knowledge and wisdom of samona culture from traditions to samon stories/proverbs to the language and still have a lot to learn 
            Those values have defintely played a core part in the person that I am today. My grandparents have always been one of the most influential people in my life even now from my nana's example of true paitence, love, kindess always finding ways to serve and my old mans example of real hard work and dedication in anything he does. This has taught me the value of always being aware of situations throughout my day where I can help and give back to someone and always striving to be 
            true and honest with the work that I do whatever it maybe and am forever thankful for them. Although I was raised by my granparents there was a part of me that always wondered about my parents and truly felt like I never belonged in one set family.
            This long felt feeling then lead me later in life in search of my parents hoping to get to know more about myself, and seeking answers to questions that I've had and eventually lead me to new experiences over in Australia.    </p>

            <h4> VIA SURVEY OF CHARACTER STRENGTH</h4>
            <ul>
             <li> Fairness </li>
             <li> Spirituality</li>
             <li> Love of Learning</li>

            <strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong>
            <p> This was my first time doing a survey like this and was quite surprise with the results that showed. There were a couple that I have come to recongise over the past few years that I personally believe are strenghts of mine such as "Love of learning"
              and Spirituality and fairness. My curiosity/love of learning will help me stay motivated and focused in my studies. Instead of just aiming to pass, I'll want to seek to understand the material and explore
            topics beyond whats required adn embrace challenges as they come seeking opporunity to constantly grow. My "spiritualy" attribute also plays a huge part personally in my growth and passing this year. My belief in god helps me stay grounded and focused 
          during my studies. Through prayer and faith I find peace in stressful moments,motivation to keep going and guidance in making better decision. Knowing that my efforts are part of a bigger purpose keeps me motivated 
        and diciplined, helping me stay on the path to success. Lastly public speaking/street contacting is one of my top strenghts I did it for about 2 years and what was one of my weakness has become one of my strengths. I would personally say altough these are a couple of strenghts of mine I've come to noticed they can also be some of my weakness as well. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <strong> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey? </strong>
              <p> There was a quote I was told a while back from a man I consider to be amazing and wise. He said "Elder Taotafa Vaimasenu'u, Always have a learners mindset, take what you like from people, your companions, co-workers, friends, family take what you like and have learned from them 
                and leave what you dont like but always have a LEARNERS MINDSET and be ALWAYS willing to learn". Now at the time I didnt get why he was telling me that but over time I've come to realise 
                my greatest strength in learning can also become my greatest weakness creating feelings of pridefulness from not wanting to learn from others or neglect the opporunity from asking for help.  
                I feel like that has in the past limit my ablitiy to move forward in my carrier and learning as well and hinder my ability to work in teams. OBVOUSILY NOT ME NOW but that has been something in the past. A huge one I have noticed recently 
                has been CONSISTENCY. Specifically when it comes to me or anything to do with me I am bad at stay consistent and get complacent real easy and feel like because I chose to do this course and its part-time it could 
                effect my future project or even group assignments which wouldnt be fair on others. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong> 
              <p>This happened a lot at my old job in Australia. I use to unload containters and then would pick and pack and do rotations between the two. 
                When on the picking and packing area we had to make sure the quality of the product was up to standard and that there were no leaks or faultys with the product if there were more faultys 
                than unsual we'd let the machine operators know. The faulty products started to come out often and I'd let the machine operator know. At the time he didnt really care 
                and just continue to say its looks fine when really it wasnt and this went on for a bit and started to affect the rest of the team and company. He was never like this and one day randomly he just stopped caring. I'm not the pushy type but I wanted to understand him a bit more and see why 
                 decide to be that way as a co-worker. I decided to ask him to see if he wanted to grab a bite after work and surpislying he accepted. We went and got some food and he just talked and talked and things at that time took a turn for the worse in his life. 
                 I didnt really talk much but listened mostly that night. He decided and spoke with our manager what was going on and eventually was able to get teh support that he needed with 
                 help from our manager and a couple of co-workers. Listening truly really goes a long way more than what people expect. Sometimes when people are venting and sharing problems 
                 it can be so easy to want to offer solutions right away when really what the person needs or is looking for is someone to hear them out and actively listen to them. I feel like 
                 this skill can be used in any setting for team work projects, solving disagrements, finding common ground between issues etc. This skill of ACTVIELY listening is really effective. </p>
