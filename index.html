      <div class="text-box"> 
      <p>TALOFA LAVA! My name is Harold Taotafa, born and raised al the way here in Auckland aka Tamaki-Makaurau. I recently just moved back from Sydney, Australia after being there for past few years and am studying this year at Dev-Academy.

        <strong> WHY DEV-ACADEMY?</strong>
        </p> Never would I have thought ever I'd be learning or doing something like this EVERRRR. I decided to give this a go and learn through dev-academy because I LOVEE GAMINGG and also I love problem solving or the procces of it and cause some old mates of mine do this so figured I'd give it a go. 
        <br>
        AM I NERVOUS? HELLL YEAHHH but definitely more keen and excitied to learn.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <strong> ANY REGRETS ON MY DECISION? </strong>
          <p> NONE! NO REGRETS SO FAR. I'm definitely happy and greatful to have chosen this carrier path espically through Dev-Academy. I thought I would have to be honest but I personally think it helps when I know I'm learning alongside others who've made huge decisons to do this but also having great mentors who guide and ginuely help us has made this journey so far reassuring and helpful.
